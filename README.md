# hello-world

I am basically Civil Engineer and been in construction industry for almost 8 years and continuing. I love technology and developed keen interest on web development and coding. I am using it as my hobby and if it comes out well, then I hope to use it in real life that will help others in the field of procurement and project management of civil engineering.
